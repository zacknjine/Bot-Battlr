# Bot Battlr

Welcome to Bot Battlr, the ultimate galactic web app where you can custom build your own Bot Army! As a galactic web developer, your task is to develop a web app that allows users to browse a list of robots, view their details, and manage their bot army.

## Learning Goals

- Implement a mini web app to practice components, props, state, events, and data fetching in React.

## Instructions

1. Display a list of available bots.
2. Add a bot to your army by clicking on it.
3. Release a bot from your army.
4. Discharge a bot from service permanently, which will remove it from both the frontend and the backend.
